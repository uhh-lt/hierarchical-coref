Third reason : Because I want my boy Harry , who is over there at the hospital in London studying to become a doctor , to have something to amuse him and keep him out of mischief for a week or so . 
Hospital work must sometimes pall and grow rather dull , for even of cutting up dead bodies there may come satiety , and as this history will not be dull , whatever else it may be , it will put a little life into things for a day or two while Harry is reading of our adventures . 
Fourth reason and last : Because I am going to tell the strangest story that I remember . 
It may seem a queer thing to say , especially considering that there is no woman in it -- except Foulata . 
Stop , though ! 
there is Gagaoola , if she was a woman , and not a fiend . 
But she was a hundred at least , and therefore not marriageable , so I do n't count her . 
At any rate , I can safely say that there is not a _ petticoat _ in the whole history . 
Well , I had better come to the yoke . 
It is a stiff place , and I feel as though I were bogged up to the axle . 
But , " _ sutjes , sutjes _ , " as the Boers say -- I am sure I do n't know how they spell it -- softly does it . 
A strong team will come through at last , that is , if they are not too poor . 
You can never do anything with poor oxen . 
Now to make a start . 
I , Allan Quatermain , of Durban , Natal , Gentleman , make oath and say -- That 's how I headed my deposition before the magistrate about poor Khiva 's and Ventv√∂gel 's sad deaths ; but somehow it does n't seem quite the right way to begin a book . 
And , besides , am I a gentleman ? 
What is a gentleman ? 
I do n't quite know , and yet I have had to do with niggers -- no , I will scratch out that word " niggers , " for I do not like it . 
I 've known natives who _ are _ , and so you will say , Harry , my boy , before you have done with this tale , and I have known mean whites with lots of money and fresh out from home , too , who _ are not _ .
